# Monte-Carlo-for-1D-harmonic-osillator

A Monte Carlo program for a classical 1D harmonic oscillator, perform simulations at different temperatures and compare the resulting probabillity distribution with analytical results.

Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo simulations sample from a probability distribution for each variable to produce hundres or thousands of possible outcomes. The results are analyzed to get probabilities of different outcomes occurring.
